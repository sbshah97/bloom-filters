#Â Bloom Filters

# Bloom Filters in Go

This project implements a Bloom Filter data structure in Go. A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. `main.go`: Contains the implementation of the Bloom Filter.
2. `bloom_filter_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the Bloom Filter implementation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/).

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bloom-filter-go.git
   cd bloom-filter-go
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```
   go test
   ```

4. Run the main program:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

For those new to Bloom Filters, this project is structured to guide you through the implementation process with progressive test cases. Follow these steps to understand and implement a Bloom Filter:

1. **Basic Structure**: 
   - Implement the basic structure of a Bloom Filter (array of bits, hash functions).
   - Test: Create a Bloom Filter with a given size and number of hash functions.

2. **Add Operation**: 
   - Implement the method to add an element to the Bloom Filter.
   - Test: Add an element and verify that the corresponding bits are set.

3. **Query Operation**: 
   - Implement the method to check if an element might be in the set.
   - Test: Query for added elements (should return true) and non-added elements (should mostly return false).

4. **False Positive Rate**: 
   - Calculate and verify the false positive rate.
   - Test: Add a set of elements, then query for a different set and measure the false positive rate.

5. **Optimization**: 
   - Implement methods to optimize the size of the filter and number of hash functions based on the expected number of elements and desired false positive rate.
   - Test: Create filters with different parameters and compare their effectiveness.

6. **Serialization** (Optional):
   - Implement methods to save and load the Bloom Filter state.
   - Test: Save a filter's state, load it, and verify that queries still work correctly.

Each step builds upon the previous one, allowing you to gradually understand and implement the Bloom Filter concept. The accompanying test file (`bloom_filter_test.go`) will contain test cases for each step, helping you verify your implementation as you progress.

By following this guide and running the tests at each step, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how Bloom Filters work and how to implement them efficiently in Go.
